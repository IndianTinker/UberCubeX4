The Benchtop LED Cube

This cube is a very tiny implementation of the LED cube Idea. Currently Its installed on my car dashboard. In order to make it as sturdy as 
possible the lower part of the cube was made in a Laser Cut Enclosure. 

This project was based on the awesome idea my Thomas Frey that used half cube multiplexing that reduces pin count.

It runs happily on MSP430G2553 microcontroller by TI and compiles on both GCC and CCS.
